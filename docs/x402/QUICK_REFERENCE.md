## 💡 The WOW Factor (Time-Travel)

**What it does:** Reconstruct exact payment state at ANY point in time

**Why it matters:** Impossible with PostgreSQL/MongoDB/Redis

**Demo script:**
1. Show payment in feed
2. Click "Time Travel" button
3. Select timestamp BEFORE payment
4. Show: no payment exists
5. Select timestamp AFTER payment
6. Show: complete payment details
7. Emphasize: "This is only possible with event sourcing"

---

## 🚨 Emergency Contacts

**Solana devnet down?** → Enable mock mode: `MOCK_SOLANA=true`

**WebSocket fails?** → Use polling fallback (see checklist)

**Out of time?** → Record video FIRST, then polish

**Stuck > 30 min?** → Ask for help in community!

---

## 📋 Pre-Recording Checklist

- [ ] Close unnecessary apps
- [ ] Clear browser history
- [ ] Test audio levels
- [ ] 1080p recording quality
- [ ] Script in front of you
- [ ] Demo URLs work
- [ ] Time-travel feature ready

## 🎬 Video Script (2 minutes)

**0:00-0:30** → Problem + 3-line solution
**0:30-0:50** → Make paid AI call
**0:50-1:10** → Dashboard real-time update
**1:10-1:40** → ⭐ TIME-TRAVEL DEMO ⭐
**1:40-2:00** → Wrap-up + CTA

---

## 🎯 Scope Priority

### MUST HAVE
1. Payment flow (402 → verify → process)
2. Time-travel feature
3. Demo video
4. Working deployment

### SHOULD HAVE
5. Real-time dashboard
6. Basic analytics
7. Good README

### NICE TO HAVE
8. Fraud detection
9. Advanced charts
10. Comprehensive tests

**If running out of time, cut from bottom up!**

## 💪 Motivational Reminders

- ✅ Chronos is already built → You're showcasing, not building from scratch
- ✅ Time-travel is your killer feature → Focus here for max impact
- ✅ Good demo video > Perfect code → Ship, don't perfect
- ✅ You have 70% done already → Just need the x402 wrapper

**You've got this! 🚀**
