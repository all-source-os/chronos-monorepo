🚀 Building AllSource Chronos: The First AI-Native Event Store

After months of development, I'm excited to share progress on AllSource Chronos - an open-source, high-performance event store designed from the ground up for AI agents and modern distributed systems.

📊 CURRENT STATE (v1.0 Complete, Phase 1.5: 70%)

Performance Metrics:
• 469,000 events/sec ingestion throughput
• 11.9μs query latency (p99)
• 7.98ms concurrent writes (8 threads)
• 86/86 tests passing (100% pass rate)
• 100% test coverage in domain/application layers

Architecture:
✅ Rust core for ultra-high-performance operations
✅ Go control plane for multi-tenancy, RBAC, and policies
✅ TypeScript MCP server for AI agent integration
✅ Apache Parquet storage for efficient columnar format
✅ Clean Architecture + SOLID principles throughout

🤖 WHAT MAKES IT AI-NATIVE?

We're combining lessons from SierraDB and Agentic Postgres to create something unique:

1. MCP Protocol Integration
   → AI agents as first-class citizens
   → Embedded event sourcing expertise in tool prompts
   → Multi-turn conversational context

2. Instant Experimentation
   → Copy-on-write event store forks
   → Sandboxed testing without affecting production
   → TTL-based automatic cleanup

3. Native Search Capabilities
   → Vector search for semantic queries (fastembed + HNSW)
   → BM25 keyword search (tantivy)
   → Hybrid search combining semantic + keyword + metadata
   → Zero external dependencies (no Elasticsearch!)

4. Function Over Interface
   → Programmatic-first design
   → Autonomous operations
   → Machine-speed workflows

🎯 ROADMAP HIGHLIGHTS

🏗️ KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Clean Architecture:
→ Domain: Pure business entities (zero dependencies)
→ Application: Use cases orchestrating domain logic
→ Infrastructure: Concrete adapter implementations
→ Frameworks: Web servers, databases, external services

SOLID Principles:
→ Single Responsibility: Each module has one reason to change
→ Open/Closed: Open for extension via traits/interfaces
→ Liskov Substitution: Subtypes are fully substitutable
→ Interface Segregation: Small, focused abstractions
→ Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

💡 LESSONS LEARNED

From SierraDB:
• Partition-based architecture for horizontal scaling
• Gapless version guarantees with watermarks
• Long-running stress tests (7-day continuous)
• Storage integrity checks and corruption detection

From Agentic Postgres:
• Embedded expertise in MCP tools
• Copy-on-write for instant forks
• Native search eliminating external dependencies
• Agent-optimized pricing and resource models

🔗 OPEN SOURCE & COMMUNITY

AllSource Chronos is MIT licensed and developed in the open. We're learning in public and welcome contributors.

Current Focus:
→ Completing Phase 1.5 Clean Architecture refactoring
→ Enhancing MCP server with embedded expertise
→ Implementing native search capabilities
→ Performance optimization towards 1M+ events/sec

Tech Stack:
🦀 Rust for core event store
🐹 Go for control plane
🎯 Clojure for query processing
📦 Parquet for storage
🤖 MCP for AI integration

📈 WHY THIS MATTERS

Event sourcing is critical for:
• Audit trails and compliance
• Temporal queries and time-travel
• Event-driven architectures
• CQRS patterns
• Real-time analytics

But existing solutions aren't built for AI agents. They require human-in-the-loop operations and external search dependencies.

AllSource Chronos changes that:
✅ AI agents can query autonomously
✅ Embedded expertise guides best practices
✅ Instant experimentation with safe forks
✅ Semantic search understands intent
✅ All-in-one solution (no external services)

🔧 Technical Deep Dive: Building an AI-Native Event Store

I'm building AllSource Chronos - an event store designed specifically for AI agents. Here's what I've learned after implementing Clean Architecture in Rust + Go + Clojure.

📊 ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

1️⃣ Why Rust for the Core?
• Zero-cost abstractions
• Memory safety without GC pauses
• Lock-free data structures (DashMap)
• SIMD support for batch processing
• Result: 469K events/sec baseline

2️⃣ Why Go for Control Plane?
• Excellent concurrency primitives
• Fast compilation for rapid iteration
• Strong ecosystem for HTTP/gRPC
• Easy JWT/RBAC implementation
• Great observability tools

3️⃣ Why Clojure for Queries?
• REPL-driven development
• Immutable data structures
• Powerful query DSL capabilities
• Transducers for efficiency
• Interactive exploration

4️⃣ Why MCP for AI?
• Agent-first protocol
• Embedded expertise in prompts
• Multi-turn conversations
• Function calling optimized
• No custom driver development

🎯 CLEAN ARCHITECTURE IN PRACTICE

Domain Layer (Rust):
```rust
pub struct Event {
    pub event_id: EventId,
    pub entity_id: EntityId,
    pub event_type: String,
    pub payload: EventPayload,
    pub timestamp: Timestamp,
}

pub trait EventRepository {
    async fn save(&self, event: Event) -> Result<()>;
    async fn find_by_id(&self, id: EventId) -> Result<Option<Event>>;
}
```

Benefits:
✅ Zero dependencies on frameworks
✅ 100% test coverage (86/86 passing)
✅ Business logic is pure and portable
✅ Swap implementations easily

Application Layer:
```rust
pub struct IngestEventUseCase {
    event_repository: Arc<dyn EventRepository>,
    event_validator: Arc<dyn EventValidator>,
}

impl IngestEventUseCase {
    pub async fn execute(&self, dto: IngestEventDTO) -> Result<EventId> {
        let event = self.event_validator.validate(dto)?;
        self.event_repository.save(event).await?;
        Ok(event.event_id)
    }
}
```

📈 PERFORMANCE JOURNEY

v1.0 Baseline:
• 469K events/sec
• 11.9μs query latency
• Lock-free data structures
• Zero-cost field access

v1.2 Targets:
• 1M+ events/sec (+113%)
• <5μs latency (-58%)
• SIMD-JSON parsing
• Async I/O batching
• Optimized batch processing

Techniques:
→ Lock-free concurrency (DashMap)
→ Memory pools for allocations
→ Vectorized operations (SIMD)
→ Zero-copy deserialization
→ Partition-based scaling

🤖 AI-NATIVE FEATURES

Problem: Traditional databases require human operators
Solution: Embed expertise directly in the interface

MCP Tool Example:
```typescript
{
  name: 'query_events',
  description: `Query events with flexible filters.

  💡 AGENT GUIDANCE:
  - entity_id: Track specific lifecycle
  - event_type: Behavior analysis
  - 'as_of': Point-in-time audit

  🎯 PATTERNS:
  - User journey: entity_id + time range
  - System health: event_type + frequency
  - Compliance: 'as_of' reconstruction

  ⚠️ PERFORMANCE:
  - Use 'limit' for exploration
  - event_type filters use indexes`,
  // schema...
}
```

Result: Agents query autonomously without trial-and-error

🔬 WHAT'S NEXT
