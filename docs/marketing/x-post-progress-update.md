No external dependencies needed 🎯
```

### Tweet 5/6 (What's Next)
```
🎯 Roadmap: Q1 2026

v1.1 (6-7 weeks):
→ Partition architecture
→ Gapless version guarantees
→ Event store forks for AI agents
→ 7-day stress tests

v1.2 (7-9 weeks):
→ 1M+ events/sec (+113%)
→ <5μs latency (-58%)
→ Native search (vector + keyword)
```

### Tweet 6/6 (Learning in Public + CTA)
```
Building in public has been incredible 🙏

Key learnings:

## Alternative: "What Changed" Focus

### Tweet 1/5
```
3 months ago I announced AllSource Chronos v0.5

Today: v1.0 shipped + Phase 1.5 at 70%

Here's what changed (and what I learned building in public)

🧵
```

### Tweet 2/5
```
The Numbers:

v0.5 → v1.0

Tests: 0 → 86 ✅
Throughput: TBD → 469K events/sec
Latency: TBD → 11.9μs (p99)
Coverage: ~0% → 100% (domain + app)

All while refactoring to Clean Architecture 🏗️

How? Thread continues...
```

### Tweet 3/5
```
What We Learned:

1️⃣ TDD is non-negotiable
   86 tests caught regressions during refactoring

2️⃣ Clean Architecture pays off fast
   Swapping implementations takes minutes, not days

3️⃣ Lock-free > Locks
   DashMap eliminated all contention bottlenecks

4️⃣ Community shapes product
   Your feedback led to AI-native features
```

### Tweet 4/5
```
What's Different Now:

🦀 Rust core with proven performance
🐹 Go control plane (multi-tenancy + RBAC)
📦 TypeScript MCP server (AI-first)
⏱️ Time-travel queries (point-in-time reconstruction)
✅ 100% test coverage (domain + application)

Next: Native search, event forks, 1M+ events/sec
```

### Tweet 5/5
```
Phase 1.5 Goals:

Current: 70% complete
Target: Q1 2026 completion

✅ Clean Architecture migration
✅ AI-native MCP interface
⏳ Native vector + keyword search
⏳ Copy-on-write event forks
⏳ 1M+ events/sec performance

Building in public continues 🚀
