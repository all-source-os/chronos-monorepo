### 3. Show Vulnerability
```
[Both platforms]
Honest moment: When I announced v0.5, I had ZERO tests.

Today: 86 tests, 100% pass rate.

Biggest lesson? Start with TDD from day one.

Here's what happened in between: [thread]
```

### 4. Create Discussion
```
[Both platforms]
Question for anyone building event sourcing systems:

What's harder to get right:
A) Performance (throughput/latency)
B) Data consistency (exactly-once)
C) Operational complexity
D) Developer experience

We focused on A+D first. Your experience?
```

### 5. Share Specific Wins
```
[Twitter thread]
Most satisfying moment shipping v1.0:

Refactored entire architecture (monolithic → Clean)
with 86 tests watching my back.

Zero regressions.
Zero production issues.
Complete confidence.

This is why TDD matters 🎯
