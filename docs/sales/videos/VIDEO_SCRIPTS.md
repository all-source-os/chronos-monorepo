# Chronos Video Content Scripts

This document contains scripts, storyboards, and recording guides for creating sales and demo videos.

---

## Video 1: Product Overview (2-3 minutes)

### Purpose
High-level introduction for landing page and social media.

### Target Audience
CTOs, Engineering Managers, AI/ML Engineers

### Script

```
[SCENE 1: Hook - 0:00-0:15]
-------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Dark screen, then code streaming effect
AUDIO: Subtle tech ambiance

NARRATOR:
"Every decision your application makes creates events.
But what if you could query any moment in time...
and let AI understand your entire event history?"

[SCENE 2: Problem Statement - 0:15-0:45]
-------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Split screen showing frustrated developer + complex architecture diagram
AUDIO: Slight tension music

NARRATOR:
"Traditional databases weren't built for event sourcing.
You're stuck with either:
- Slow queries that can't keep up
- Complex infrastructure to maintain
- Or building everything from scratch

And when AI agents need to understand your data?
Good luck with that."

[SCENE 3: Introducing Chronos - 0:45-1:30]
-------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Chronos logo animation, then architecture diagram animating in
AUDIO: Upbeat, confident music

NARRATOR:
"Meet Chronos - the AI-native event sourcing platform
built for the way modern applications work.

469,000 events per second.
Sub-microsecond queries.
27 tools for AI agents, built right in.

It's not just fast. It's designed for the AI era."

[SCENE 4: Key Features - 1:30-2:15]
-------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Feature cards animating in sequence

FEATURE 1 - PERFORMANCE
"Built with Rust at its core, Chronos delivers
469K events per second with 12 microsecond latency."

FEATURE 2 - AI NATIVE
"The only event store with native Model Context Protocol support.
Your AI agents can query events in natural language."

FEATURE 3 - TIME TRAVEL
"Query any point in history instantly.
Reconstruct entity state from any timestamp."

FEATURE 4 - POLYGLOT
"Rust for speed. Go for orchestration. Elixir for real-time.
The best tool for each job."

[SCENE 5: Call to Action - 2:15-2:30]
-------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Dashboard demo, then CTA screen

NARRATOR:
"Start building with Chronos today.
Open source. Cloud ready.
Future proof."

TEXT ON SCREEN:
github.com/[org]/chronos
"Star on GitHub"
```

-------------------------------------------
TERMINAL + CODE EDITOR

NARRATOR:
"Let's ingest some events. I'll create an order tracking scenario."

COMMANDS:
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3900/api/v1/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entity_id": "order-12345",
    "event_type": "OrderCreated",
    "data": {
      "customer_id": "cust-001",
      "items": [{"sku": "ABC", "qty": 2}],
      "total": 99.99
    }
  }'

RESPONSE:
{"event_id": "evt_abc123", "version": 1, "timestamp": "..."}

NARRATOR:
"Event ingested. Now let's add more events to build a history."

COMMANDS (rapid fire):
# OrderPaymentReceived
# OrderShipped
# OrderDelivered

[SCENE 3: Querying Events - 2:30-3:30]
-------------------------------------------
TERMINAL

NARRATOR:
"Query by entity, type, or time range. Sub-microsecond latency."

COMMANDS:
$ curl "http://localhost:3900/api/v1/events?entity_id=order-12345"

# Show formatted JSON response with 4 events

$ curl "http://localhost:3900/api/v1/events?event_type=OrderShipped&after=2024-01-01"

NARRATOR:
"Time-travel queries let you see state at any point in history."

COMMANDS:
$ curl "http://localhost:3900/api/v1/events/order-12345/state?as_of=2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"

[SCENE 4: AI Integration with MCP - 3:30-5:00]
-------------------------------------------
SPLIT SCREEN: Terminal + Claude Desktop

NARRATOR:
"Here's where it gets interesting. Let's ask Claude about our events."

CLAUDE DESKTOP DEMO:
User: "What happened to order 12345?"

Claude: "Let me check the event history for order-12345...

Based on the events I found:
1. Order created on Jan 10 for $99.99
2. Payment received on Jan 10
3. Shipped on Jan 12
4. Delivered on Jan 15

The order was successfully fulfilled in 5 days."

NARRATOR:
"Claude used the MCP tools to query Chronos naturally.
No custom code. No manual API calls."

User: "Were there any delays compared to similar orders?"

Claude: "Analyzing patterns across order events...
This order took 5 days from creation to delivery.
The average for similar orders is 4.2 days.
Slightly longer, but within normal range."

[SCENE 5: Real-time Subscriptions - 5:00-6:00]
-------------------------------------------
TERMINAL WITH WEBSOCKET CLIENT

NARRATOR:
"Real-time subscriptions via WebSocket."

COMMANDS:
$ wscat -c "ws://localhost:3902/socket/websocket"
> {"topic": "events:order-*", "event": "phx_join", "payload": {}, "ref": 1}
< {"event": "phx_reply", "payload": {"status": "ok"}}

# Show events streaming in as they're ingested

[SCENE 6: Wrap Up - 6:00-6:30]
-------------------------------------------
DASHBOARD + TERMINAL SIDE BY SIDE

NARRATOR:
"That's Chronos.
High-performance event sourcing.
AI-native from day one.
Try it yourself - link in the description."
```

[SCENE 3: Tool Showcase - 1:30-3:00]
-------------------------------------------
CLAUDE DESKTOP: Live interaction

NARRATOR (over shoulder view):

"Watch what happens when I ask about customer behavior..."

USER: "Show me the purchase patterns for customer cust-001 over the last month"

CLAUDE RESPONSE (animate typing):
"I'll analyze the events for this customer...

[Uses query_events tool]
[Uses find_patterns tool]

Customer cust-001 Purchase Analysis:
- 4 orders in the last 30 days
- Average order value: $127.50
- Preferred category: Electronics
- Typical order time: Weekday evenings
- Payment method: Always credit card

Pattern detected: Increasing order frequency
(1 order/week in Jan -> 2 orders/week in Feb)"

NARRATOR:
