## Format

Each ADR follows the structure:
- **Context**: What problem are we solving?
- **Decision**: What did we decide and why?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?

ADRs are immutable once accepted. If a decision is reversed, a new ADR supersedes the old one (with a `Superseded by` link).
