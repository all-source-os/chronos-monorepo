**Current Version**: v0.10.3

## What Can It Do?

Connect Claude Desktop (or any MCP client) to your AllSource event store and ask questions like:

- *"What changed for user-123 yesterday?"*
- *"Show me the signup-to-purchase funnel for the last 30 days"*
- *"Which entities have anomalous activity patterns?"*
- *"Forecast event volume for next week"*
- *"Compare user-123 and user-456 side by side"*

The MCP server translates natural language into precise event store queries, returns results in a token-efficient format, and maintains conversation context across multi-turn interactions.

## Quick Start

### 1. Start AllSource Services

```bash
# Core Event Store
cd apps/core && cargo run --release

# Control Plane (optional, needed for tenant management)
cd apps/control-plane && go run .
```

### 2. Start MCP Server

```bash
cd apps/mcp-server-elixir
mix deps.get
mix run --no-halt
```

### 3. Connect Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "allsource": {
      "command": "mix",
      "args": ["run", "--no-halt"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/all-source/apps/mcp-server-elixir"
    }
  }
}
```

Or with a compiled release:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "allsource": {
      "command": "/path/to/apps/mcp-server-elixir/_build/dev/rel/mcp_server_elixir/bin/mcp_server_elixir",
      "args": ["start"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Architecture note:** `migrate_schema`, `infer_schema`, and `schema_diff` use Core's schema registry and event query APIs for data retrieval, then perform lightweight computation (structural diffing, type inference) client-side in the MCP server. This is intentional — these operations are simple map comparisons and type detection that don't warrant dedicated Core endpoints. `register_schema`, `validate_schema`, and `list_schemas` are fully backed by Core's schema registry API.

## Use Case: E-Commerce Order Investigation

This walkthrough shows how an AI assistant uses the MCP server to investigate a customer support issue end-to-end.

**Scenario:** Customer reports they were charged but never received a confirmation email.

### Step 1: Discover — Orient yourself

```
User: "Customer user-4821 says they were charged but got no confirmation. What happened?"

AI calls: quick_stats
→ 142,387 events across 8,291 entities — system is healthy

AI calls: get_cluster_status
→ Single-node mode, healthy, replication: null
```

### Step 2: Search — Find the customer's events

```
AI calls: query_events
  entity_id: "user-4821"
  limit: 50

→ 23 events found:
  - user.created (2026-01-15)
  - cart.item_added (x3)
  - checkout.started
  - payment.initiated
  - payment.succeeded     ← charge went through
  - order.created
  - (no email.confirmation.sent event!)
```

### Step 3: Drill down — Reconstruct state at the time

```
AI calls: event_timeline
  entity_id: "user-4821"
  since: "2026-02-15T00:00:00Z"

→ Timeline shows payment.succeeded at 14:32:07Z
  followed by order.created at 14:32:08Z
  then... nothing. No email event.

AI calls: analyze_changes
  entity_id: "user-4821"
  from: "2026-02-15T14:32:00Z"
  to: "2026-02-15T14:33:00Z"

→ State changed from {order_status: "pending"} to {order_status: "created"}
  but email_sent remained false
```

### Step 4: Find patterns — Is this systemic?

```
AI calls: find_patterns
  event_type: "payment.succeeded"
  since: "2026-02-15T00:00:00Z"

→ Pattern detected: 47 payment.succeeded events today,
  but only 41 email.confirmation.sent events.
  6 orders missing confirmation emails — all between 14:30-14:45Z.

AI calls: query_events
  event_type: "email.service.error"
  since: "2026-02-15T14:00:00Z"

→ Found: email.service.error at 14:29:55Z
  payload: {provider: "sendgrid", error: "rate_limit_exceeded", retry_after: 900}
```

### Step 5: Resolution

```
AI: "Found the issue. The email service (SendGrid) hit a rate limit at 14:29:55Z,
which caused 6 confirmation emails to fail between 14:30-14:45Z. User-4821's
order was created successfully and payment went through — only the confirmation
email was dropped. Recommend: retry the 6 failed emails and check the email
service error handling for rate limit backoff."
```

### What the MCP server provided

- **5 tool calls** to go from vague complaint to root cause
- **No SQL, no dashboard clicking, no log grep** — natural language throughout
- **Time-travel analysis** to reconstruct exact system state at failure time
- **Pattern detection** to identify it's a systemic issue, not a one-off

## Token-Efficient Responses

All tools return responses in **TOON format** by default — approximately **50% fewer tokens** than JSON for tabular data. This directly reduces LLM API costs and speeds up processing.

| Format | Tokens (typical) | Use Case |
|--------|:----------------:|----------|
| TOON (default) | ~500 | Tabular data, lists, summaries |
| JSON | ~1,000 | Complex nested structures |

Override per-request with `format: "json"` or `format: "toon"`.

## Access Control

Tools are gated by configuration to prevent unintended modifications:

| Gate | Tools Affected | Default |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Read-only mode** | All write operations (ingest, delete, archive, import, clone, merge, split, compact, backup create/restore) | Off |
| **Control Plane** | All tenant management tools | Enabled when Control Plane URL is configured |

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Won't Start
```bash
elixir --version           # Check Elixir is installed
curl localhost:3900/health # Check Core is running
curl localhost:3901/health # Check Control Plane is running
```

### Claude Desktop Not Connecting
- Restart Claude Desktop completely
- Check config path is absolute
- Verify MCP logs in `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`

### Tool Calls Failing
- Use ISO timestamps (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`)
- Check entity exists before querying
- Test the underlying API directly with curl

### Tools Vanish Mid-Session / Connection Flaps
stdout is the JSON-RPC channel — anything else written there is protocol garbage
to the client, and a crash in the server process drops the stream outright. Two
causes were fixed in #229: Logger defaulted to `:standard_io` (now
`:standard_error`, set in `config/config.exs`), and an exception while handling a
request took the server GenServer down with it. Request handling is now wrapped
at the seam (`Server.guarded_process/2`, around the whole of `process_request/2`)
so JSON-RPC parsing, argument shaping, tool dispatch and response encoding all
degrade to a `-32603` error instead of a process exit — including
client-controlled shape errors such as `"arguments"` arriving as a JSON string
rather than an object. That matters because the supervisor's default
`max_restarts: 3` in 5s means four fatal requests in five seconds would take the
whole application down, not just the session.

A third cause was found later, on the *quiet* side of the same stream: the
server answered JSON-RPC **notifications**. `JsonRpc.normalize_request/1` always
puts an `:id` key in the request map (nil when the client sent none), so the
"unknown notification — no response needed" clause in `process_request/2` was
unreachable and every notification drew a frame with `"id": null` onto stdout.
MCP clients send `notifications/cancelled` and `notifications/progress` as a
matter of course, so cancelling one tool call was enough: the client gets a
response it cannot correlate, which the MCP SDK reports as "a response for an
unknown message ID". Notifications are now silent end to end (success, tool
error and crash paths alike) — see `Server.respond/2`.

If it recurs, capture the connector's **stderr** — that is where the server
logs — and check that no library you added writes to stdout.
