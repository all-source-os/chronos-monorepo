 *     store, 11.9μs recall, 469K events/sec, Apache-2.0/self-host, x402 per-call
 *     pricing, 73 MCP tools. These are defensible against our own docs.
 *   - Competitor cells mirror the homepage matrix (`sections/social-proof.tsx`)
 *     where that matrix took a position, and otherwise read "unknown" / "varies"
 *     rather than inventing a number. NEVER fabricate competitor figures.
 *   - The homepage matrix asserted: temporal `as_of` — zep yes, mem0/letta no;
 *     full event provenance / compressed index / offline-embedded / sub-ms
 *     recall — AllSource only; Apache-2.0 self-host — mem0 yes, letta/zep no.

        question: "Is stoolap better than AllSource?",
        answer:
          "They are different categories, so 'better' depends on the job. stoolap is an embedded relational SQL database — mutable tables, JOINs, a cost-based optimizer, fast local OLAP, all in your process with zero ops. AllSource is an immutable, replayable event store plus an agent-memory engine (Prime) and a hosted multi-tenant SaaS served over the network. If you want SQL over mutable data in one app, stoolap is simpler and there is nothing to operate. If you want a replayable store of record with full provenance, served to a fleet of agents with per-call billing, that is AllSource's shape. On raw in-memory speed they are close.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does stoolap have an MCP server, vector search, and time-travel like AllSource?",
        answer:
          "Yes — all three. Unlike a typical agent-memory tool, stoolap ships a first-party MCP server (30 SQL tools for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), native VECTOR(N) columns with HNSW indexing and a built-in EMBED() function (no external embedding API), and AS OF time-travel via MVCC. So none of those are AllSource-exclusive in this comparison. The difference is what they do: stoolap's MCP exposes SQL; AllSource's exposes event-store and agent-memory verbs, and AllSource's time-travel replays a permanent immutable log rather than retained MVCC versions.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is AllSource faster than stoolap?",
        answer:
          "On the only fair head-to-head — single-row in-memory ingestion plus point reads, single-thread, same M2 Max laptop, release builds — it is a near-wash. AllSource's batch path edges ahead on a clean machine (~506K vs stoolap's ~291–448K rows/sec), but the ranges overlap and depend on background load; nobody is 10× faster. stoolap's published multipliers (191× vs DuckDB, 1213× vs DuckDB on SELECT) are vendor-reported and partly inflated — an independent Better Stack test found stoolap's real OLAP advantage over SQLite to be ~4–6×. Reproduce AllSource's number yourself with `cargo run --release -p allsource-performance`.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I self-host both stoolap and AllSource?",
        answer:
          "Yes. stoolap is Apache-2.0 and embedded by design — `cargo add stoolap` (or its Node/Python/Go/Java/C#/PHP/Ruby/Swift/WASM bindings) and it runs in your process. AllSource community is Apache-2.0 too and runs embedded or as a server you self-host for free; its enterprise features are BSL 1.1, and it also offers hosted tiers. Both are permissive open source, so 'self-hostable' is true of both.",
      },
      {
        question: "Should I use stoolap or AllSource for agent memory?",
        answer:
          "If you want a turnkey agent-memory layer — durable recall, a knowledge graph, vector + recency re-ranking, and dedicated MCP tools — AllSource's Prime is purpose-built for it. stoolap gives you the raw materials (SQL, vectors, embeddings, time-travel) in one embedded engine, but you assemble the memory semantics yourself. Choose stoolap if you want full control inside one app and are happy to build the recall logic; choose AllSource/Prime if you want the memory engine and a shared, replayable backbone for a fleet of agents.",
