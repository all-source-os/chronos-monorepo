          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">5.1 Plans</h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            The hosted Service is offered in paid tiers (Indie, Studio, and Scale) and a custom
            Enterprise tier. New accounts begin with a time-limited trial, after which a paid plan
            is required to continue using the hosted Service. Each tier has defined usage limits for
            events, streams, tenants, and retention periods as described on our pricing page. The
            open-source core may also be self-hosted under its license at no charge.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">5.2 Billing</h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Paid plans are billed monthly or annually in advance. Usage-based overages, if
            applicable, are billed at the end of each billing period. All fees are non-refundable
            except as required by law.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">5.3 Trial</h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            New hosted accounts include a time-limited trial (currently 14 days) with limited
            resources so you can evaluate the Service. When the trial ends, a paid plan is required
            to continue. We reserve the right to modify trial limits or duration with 30 days&apos;
            notice.
