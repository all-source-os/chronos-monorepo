          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            AllSource (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;us&quot;) operates the AllSource
            platform, including the Chronos event store, query service, MCP server, and web
            dashboard (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;). This Privacy Policy explains how we
            collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Service.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">2.1 Account Information</h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and authentication
            credentials. If you sign up via OAuth (Google, GitHub), we receive your profile
            information from those providers.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">2.2 Usage Data</h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            We collect metrics about your use of the Service, including event ingestion counts,
            query volumes, API call frequency, and storage usage. This data is used for billing,
            capacity planning, and service improvement.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">2.3 Event Data</h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            You store event data in the AllSource event store. We do not access, analyze, or share
            the contents of your event data except as necessary to provide the Service (e.g.,
            executing your queries). Your event data remains yours.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            We automatically collect IP addresses, browser type, operating system, referring URLs,
            and device information when you interact with our web dashboard.

            Added for GEO layer 4 (docs/runbooks/GEO_MEASUREMENT.md). Section 2.3
            promises we do not read your event data — this is OUR telemetry, in our
            own tenant, and we DO read it, so it needs saying separately rather than
            being quietly covered by 2.2 "usage data".

            2.5 Attribution Answers You Choose to Give Us
          </h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            During onboarding we ask an optional question — &quot;how did you find us?&quot; — and,
            if you say an AI assistant sent you, we offer an optional free-text box asking what you
            asked it. Both are entirely optional and skipping them has no effect on your account. If
            you answer, we store your answer (including the free text, verbatim, up to 500
            characters), the option you selected, your tenant ID, your plan at the time, and the
            timestamp. We never store your email address against these answers. The same two
            optional fields are available on our self-service <code>/api/v1/onboard/start</code>{" "}
            endpoint for programmatic signups.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-2">
            Unlike the event data described in 2.3, these answers are our own operational data and{" "}
            <strong>are read by our team</strong>: we use them to work out which questions people
            ask AI assistants before finding us, and what to write next. They are not used for
            advertising, are not sold, and are not shared with third parties. Ask us and we will
            delete yours — see the Contact section below.

            Your event data is stored in the AllSource Core engine with write-ahead logging (WAL)
            and Parquet columnar storage. All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+). We implement
            industry-standard security practices including multi-tenancy isolation, role-based
            access control (RBAC), and comprehensive audit logging.

            Event data retention depends on your plan tier (7 days for Developer, 90 days for Team,
            unlimited for Enterprise). Account information is retained while your account is active
            and for a reasonable period afterward for legal and operational purposes. You may
