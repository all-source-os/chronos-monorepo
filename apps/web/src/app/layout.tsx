/*
 * ADR — analytics choice for GEO layer 1 (prompt 024)
 *
 * The site had NO analytics of any kind before this. The constraint set was:
 * Vercel-hosted Next.js App Router; must expose the raw referrer and user
 * agent; must not force a cookie-banner rewrite.
 *
 * Chosen: **Vercel Web Analytics** (`@vercel/analytics`) for cookieless
 * site-wide traffic, a first-party `<GeoReferralTracker />` beacon for the GEO
 * event stream, and GA4 with denied-by-default storage for Search Console and
 * cross-product acquisition reporting.
 *
 * Why three measurement paths rather than one product:
 * - Vercel Web Analytics is cookieless and privacy-preserving, so it adds no
 *   consent-banner obligation the site did not already have. It is served from
 *   `/_vercel/insights/*` on our own origin, so it needs no third-party CSP
 *   entries, env var, or account setup beyond enabling it in the Vercel
 *   dashboard. GA4 uses narrowly scoped script and collection origins in
 *   `next.config.mjs`.
 * - It does NOT satisfy the second constraint. Vercel shows referrers in *its*
 *   dashboard; it gives us no programmatic access to the raw referrer and user
 *   agent, and it cannot join an arrival to a conversion inside AllSource.
 *   That is precisely what layer 1 is for, hence the beacon.
 * - GA4 supplies channel, landing-page, and Google Search Console reporting
 *   shared with the other Wolven Tech products. It runs with analytics and ad
 *   storage denied, strips query strings, and disables Google Signals.
 *   First-party GEO events remain authoritative for AI referrals because GA4
 *   may group them as Direct or Referral.
 *
 * Rejected:
 * - **PostHog** — the richest option, but it sets cookies by default and would
 *   pull the site into consent-banner work that is not this slice's job.
 * - **Plausible / Fathom** — cookieless and good, but a paid third-party
 *   script host (CSP widening) for aggregate numbers Vercel already gives us
 *   free, and still no raw referrer in our own pipeline.
 *
 * Env vars to set by hand: Vercel Web Analytics needs NONE (enable it in
 * Project Settings -> Analytics). GA4 uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`,
 * with a canonical-host fallback for production. The referral route needs
 * `ALLSOURCE_API_KEY` (and optionally `ALLSOURCE_API_URL`) set in the Vercel
 * dashboard — server scope only, never `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. See
 * docs/runbooks/GEO_MEASUREMENT.md.
