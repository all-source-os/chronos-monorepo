/**
 * GEO layer 4 — the server side of the "how did you find us?" capture.
 *
 * The onboarding question (`src/components/geo-discovery-question.tsx`) posts
 * an answer here; this route validates it against the shared vocabulary,
 * resolves the tenant from the session cookie, builds the
 * `geo.selfreport.captured` envelope and forwards it to the Control Plane
 * gateway, which authenticates and injects `tenant_id` before it reaches Core.
 *
 * ## Why this route exists at all
 *
 * The AllSource ingest key must never reach the browser. A client-side `fetch`
 * to the gateway would put a writable key in the JS bundle. The key lives only
 * in this server runtime, read from `process.env` at request time.
 *
 * ## What is not trusted
 *
 * Everything in the body is attacker-controlled. In particular the client is
 * NOT asked who it is: `contact_ref` and `tier` are derived server-side from
 * the httpOnly `auth_token` cookie, so this endpoint cannot be used to attach
 * an answer to somebody else's tenant. The discovery source must be one of the
 * twelve ids in the shared vocabulary — free text there would become an
 * unqueryable mess and the AI-sourced share would stop meaning anything.
 *
 * ## Privacy
 *
 * `verbatim` is user-submitted free text. It is stored in Core as event data
 * and is operator-visible — see the layer-4 privacy note in
 * `docs/runbooks/GEO_MEASUREMENT.md` and the "Information you choose to give
 * us" clause in `src/app/(marketing)/privacy/page.tsx`. `contact_ref` is the
 * tenant id, never an email address.
