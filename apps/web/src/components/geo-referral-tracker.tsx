/**
 * GEO layer 1 — the browser half of AI-referral attribution.
 *
 * Renders nothing. On the first page view of a session it reads
 * `document.referrer` and the landing URL, and if they look like an AI surface
 * it posts them to `/api/geo/referral`. The server re-classifies and is the
 * only side holding a credential — see that route for the trust boundary.
 *
 * ## Why a beacon at all, when Vercel Web Analytics is installed
 *
 * Vercel Web Analytics gives us aggregate traffic in Vercel's dashboard. It
 * does **not** give us the raw referrer and user agent inside our own event
 * stream, and it cannot join an arrival to a conversion in AllSource. Layer 1
 * needs both, so the tracker below is ~60 lines of first-party beacon on top
 * of it rather than a second analytics vendor.
 *
 * ## Privacy
 *
 * No cookies. `sessionStorage` only, which dies with the tab and is never sent
 * to another origin. The session id is a random UUID with no link to a person.
 * Nothing here needs a consent banner that the site does not already need.
