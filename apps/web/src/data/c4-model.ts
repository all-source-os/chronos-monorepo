// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// AllSource C4 model — curated, hand-authored single source of truth for the
// public /architecture diagram. Covers the first two C4 layers only:
//   • Level 1 (System Context) — actors, the AllSource platform as ONE system,
//     and the external systems it touches.
//   • Level 2 (Container)      — the deployable containers inside the platform
//     boundary and how they talk.
//
// ACCURACY RULES (must hold — see CLAUDE.md "Architecture Facts"):
//   • Core IS the durable database: WAL (CRC32 + fsync) + Parquet (Snappy) +
//     DashMap (in-memory reads). NEVER described as in-memory-only / a cache /
//     non-durable.
//   • PostgreSQL is operational metadata ONLY (billing / subscription). It is
//     NEVER on the event path.
//   • The 5 Fly.io backends are: allsource-core, allsource-query,
//     allsource-control-plane, allsource-auth, allsource-prime.
//     The web frontend is on Vercel (www.all-source.xyz).
//   • Topology: Clients → Query Service (gateway: auth, billing, routing) →
//     Core. Control Plane owns public auth + billing.
//
// When unsure about a relationship, OMIT it rather than guess.
