// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// AllSource Ecosystem model — curated, hand-authored single source of truth for
// the public /ecosystem diagram. This is the AGENT-FIRST companion to the C4
// /architecture page: that page = how the platform is built; this page = what
// an AI agent can DO with it and exactly how to wire each piece.
//
// It is a BIPARTITE graph:
//   • capability nodes  — what an AI agent can DO (remember, recall, build a
//     graph, track tasks, ingest/query events, stream, start with no signup,
//     use it from Claude Desktop).
//   • app/endpoint nodes — the PUBLIC, agent-usable apps / products / endpoints
//     that provide those abilities (prime-mcp, the DXT, chronis, the SDKs, the
//     public HTTP/WS API, /connect, crates.io, GitHub).
// Edges go capability -> app/endpoint ("this is how you get this ability").
//
// ACCURACY RULES (the #1 failure mode is inaccuracy — verify, don't invent):
//   • PUBLIC surface ONLY. Public hosts: api.all-source.xyz (Control Plane
//     gateway), allsource-query.fly.dev (Query Service), www.all-source.xyz
//     (dashboard). NEVER show *.internal hosts or internal-only services.
//   • Prime is ALWAYS a local stdio binary: `cargo install allsource-prime`.
//     "Hosted" = the same binary + `--sync-to https://api.all-source.xyz
//     --api-key <key>`. There is no hosted MCP transport URL.
//   • crates.io publishes the Rust crates: allsource-prime (the MCP binary),
//     allsource (Rust SDK), chronis (the `cn` CLI binary). The TS SDK is on
//     npm as `@allsourcedev/client`; Python / Go SDKs are GitHub-registry only
//     — never print a fake `pip install`/`go get` from a registry.
//   • The DXT for Claude Desktop ships via GitHub releases:
//     github.com/all-source-os/all-source/releases/latest/download/allsource-prime.dxt
//   • prime_* tool names are the REAL tool names from apps/prime-mcp/src.
//
// Verified against (2026-06): apps/prime-mcp/src/tools.rs + dispatch.rs (tool
// names + the real clap flags), apps/web/src/lib/integrations.ts (the canonical
// MCP-config envelope), apps/web/src/app/(marketing)/sdks/page.tsx (the real
// SDK channels), apps/web/content/allsource-as-cms-from-claude-desktop.mdx +
// docs/proposals/AGENT_DRIVEN_PRIME_ONBOARDING.md (anonymous-trial + /connect),
// apps/web/content/audit-trails-soc2-event-sourcing.mdx (the events curl).
//
// When unsure about an endpoint or command, OMIT it rather than guess.
