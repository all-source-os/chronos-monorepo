    question: "Is AllSource the same product as ArcGIS AllSource?",

    question: "What is the difference between AllSource Core and AllSource Prime?",

    question: "Is AllSource a vector database?",

  },
  {
    question: "Does AllSource require PostgreSQL?",
    answer:
      "No. Core stores events and event-sourced operational metadata. Query Service derives tenant-scoped reads from Core, so current AllSource services require no PostgreSQL instance.",

    question: "Are AllSource MCP and Prime MCP the same connector?",

      "No. The event-store connector exposes 45 read-only tools, 55 by default, 64 with control-plane access, and 73 with system administration. Prime has a separate memory-oriented registry with 19 prime_* tools and 27 when optional inbox and hound modules are enabled.",
