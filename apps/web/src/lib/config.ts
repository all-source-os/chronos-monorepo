      question: "How much does AllSource cost?",
      answer:
        "Hosted AllSource starts at £18.99/month for Indie (500K events/month, 14-day retention, 3 streams). Studio is £78.99/month (5M events, 90-day retention, unlimited streams) and Scale is £298.99/month (50M events, 365-day retention). Enterprise is negotiated. The live LemonSqueezy catalog is authoritative.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does AllSource have a free tier?",
      answer:
        "No free hosted tier. AllSource Core and community components are available under Apache-2.0, so the community route can be self-hosted on your own hardware. Designated enterprise features use BSL 1.1. Hosted plans start with a 14-day trial (1,000 events) and then require a paid tier.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I exceed my monthly event quota?",
      answer:
        "Each paid tier includes metered x402 micropayment credits: 50K calls on Indie, 500K on Studio, 5M on Scale. Beyond the included allowance, usage bills at $0.0001 per call. Events themselves are quota'd per tier, so sustained overage is a signal to move up rather than an open-ended bill.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I self-host AllSource instead of paying?",
      answer:
        "Yes. The core event store is Apache-2.0 licensed and runs anywhere Docker does, with unlimited events, forever retention, unlimited streams, and full MCP access on your own infrastructure. Some enterprise-specific features are licensed under BSL 1.1. Self-hosting is supported through GitHub rather than email or Slack.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is AllSource priced per seat or per user?",
      answer:
        "Neither. AllSource prices on events written and retained, not on people. A team of one and a team of thirty pay the same for the same event volume, because the cost driver is agent throughput and retention window — not headcount. Streams and MCP access level vary by tier.",
    },
  ],
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Why no free plan?",

      question: "What is AllSource?",

      question: "Is AllSource the same as ArcGIS AllSource?",

      question: "How does AllSource compare to traditional databases?",
      answer:

        "AllSource has separate MCP connectors. The event-store connector exposes 45 read-only tools, 55 by default, 64 with control-plane access, and 73 with system administration. Prime exposes 19 prime_* memory tools, or 27 with optional inbox and hound modules. Do not add these registries together.",
