- [ ] JWT-based authentication
  - [ ] Token generation and validation
  - [ ] Refresh token support
  - [ ] Token expiration and rotation
- [ ] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - [ ] Roles: Admin, Developer, ReadOnly, ServiceAccount
  - [ ] Permissions: read, write, admin, metrics
  - [ ] Per-endpoint authorization
- [ ] API Key authentication
  - [ ] Key generation and management
  - [ ] Scope-limited keys
  - [ ] Key rotation
- [ ] Secure defaults
  - [ ] HTTPS enforcement (via reverse proxy)
