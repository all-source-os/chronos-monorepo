/// Lock-free data structures for high-performance concurrent operations
///
/// # Overview
/// This module provides lock-free implementations of common data structures
/// used in the event store's hot paths. By eliminating lock contention,
/// these structures provide:
///
/// - **10-100x lower latency** compared to mutex-based alternatives
/// - **Predictable performance** under high concurrent load
/// - **Better scalability** with increasing thread count
///
/// # Components
///
/// ## LockFreeEventQueue
/// Multi-producer, multi-consumer queue for event ingestion pipeline.
/// - Eliminates RwLock contention in hot path
/// - Provides backpressure handling when full
/// - ~10-20ns push/pop operations
///
/// ## LockFreeMetrics
/// Atomic metrics collector for monitoring.
/// - Zero contention on metric updates
/// - ~5-10ns per metric recording
/// - Suitable for high-frequency operations
///
/// # When to Use
///
/// Use lock-free structures when:
/// - Operation frequency > 100K/sec per thread
/// - Multiple threads accessing same structure
/// - Latency predictability is critical
/// - Lock contention is observed in profiling
///
/// Use regular locks when:
/// - Operation frequency < 10K/sec
/// - Simple single-threaded access
/// - Complex state updates needed
/// - Atomic cross-field invariants required
///
/// # Performance Notes
///
/// Lock-free operations use atomic CPU instructions (e.g., CAS - Compare-And-Swap).
/// While fast, they can still cause cache-line bouncing under extreme contention.
/// For best performance:
///
/// - Use separate instances per logical partition/shard
/// - Batch operations when possible
/// - Consider queue capacity vs. memory trade-off
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// use crate::infrastructure::persistence::lock_free::{LockFreeEventQueue, LockFreeMetrics};
///
/// // Create queue for event ingestion
/// let queue = LockFreeEventQueue::new(10000);
/// let metrics = LockFreeMetrics::new();
///
/// // Producer thread
/// queue.try_push(event)?;
/// metrics.record_ingest();
///
/// // Consumer thread
/// if let Some(event) = queue.try_pop() {
///     process_event(event)?;
///     metrics.record_query(latency);
/// }
/// ```
